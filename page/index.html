{! Section.nav(C, "about") !}

<p>I am Coranna. I observe. I break. I make. I confound.</p>

<p>I write at <a target="_blank" href="http://allopoeia.komiga.com">Allopoeia</a>. Sometimes I make <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/random-va">voices</a> (and imitations of non-voices), <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/things-that-resemble-music">music</a> (maybe), and <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/things-that-resemble-sound">sounds</a>.</p>

<p>Talk to me if you must know more.</p>


{! Section.nav(C, "code") !}

{! Section.item(C, "All the Maths‽", "https://github.com/komiga/am", "am") !}

<p>A mathematics library for C++. It currently does linear algebra (in the dialect of OpenGL) and string hashing (Fowler-Noll-Vo and Murmur).</p>


{! Section.item(C, "Beard", "https://github.com/komiga/Beard") !}

<p>A terminal UI for C++. Because ncurses is an abomination. In the interest of fairness, Beard also happens to be an abomination. Must be the TTY sickness.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "Cacophony", "https://github.com/komiga/Cacophony") !}

<p>A serialization library for C++. It is similar to <a target="_blank" href="http://uscilab.github.io/cereal">cereal</a>, but doesn't dabble in polymorphism, type registration, or RTTI, instead requiring explicit hierarchic serialization.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "duct") !}

<p>A general-purpose library for multiple languages. It began in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/duct-max">BlitzMax</a>, but was eventually ported to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/duct-cpp">C++</a> and partially to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/duct-sharp">C♯</a>.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/duct-cpp">duct++</a> was given the most care, but it is being neglected in favor of <a href="#togo">togo</a>. It carries its own weight (with zero dependencies) and features the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Compiler and platform detection macros.</li>
	<li>Debug message and assertion macros.</li>
	<li>Endian byte-swapping.</li>
	<li>Unicode encoding and string conversion helpers.</li>
	<li>iostream helpers for binary and textual data (integrates with the C++ Standard Library).</li>
	<li>Dynamic-memory and multi-cast stream classes.</li>
	<li>Generic token parsing and argument parsing.</li>
	<li>A general-purpose markup language with pattern-matching.</li>
	<li>Set of macros for scoped error reporting and messaging.</li>
	<li>Miscellaneous utilities and common classes.</li>
</ul>


{! Section.item(C, "precore", "https://github.com/komiga/precore") !}

<p>An extension of <a target="_blank" href="http://industriousone.com/what-premake">Premake</a>. It facilitates build setup reuse, making the already pleasant Premake even more pleasant.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "togo", "https://github.com/komiga/togo") !}

<p>A C++ data-oriented super-library. It began as a game engine, but I found its design too appealing to leave it all bound up in a high-dependency library. As a result, togo is now composed of multiple components (libraries and tools). I am using it for all of my new projects, largely eschewing the C++ stdlib.</p>

<p>It seems likely that many of the projects I created under different design principles will eventually be recrafted within togo.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "Short list") !}

<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/include_sort">include_sort</a>: order-explicit inclusion sorter for C and C++ (supremely silly).</li>

	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/igen">igen</a>: libclang-based interface generator for C++ (abominable).</li>

	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/brinktools">brinktools</a>: some shabby code for reading BRINK's SDMD2 and SDPK2 formats (including documentation; warning: code uses legacy duct++ API).</li>

	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/trait_wrangler">Trait Wrangler</a>: a small C++ library for trait testing &amp; common trait compounds.</li>
</ul>


{! Section.nav(C, "games") !}

{! Section.item(C, "Onomo", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&amp;uid=14542") !}

<p>A dark, moody platformer concept created over a 48-hour period for Ludum Dare 30. I neglected mechanics and made <em>something</em> that is only compelling in aesthetic. The code is <a href="https://github.com/komiga/ld30-onomo">available</a> under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 3.0</a> license.</p>

{! Section.item(C, "Prisma", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;uid=14542") !}

<p>A minimalistic color-based quasi-puzzle game created over a 72-hour period for Ludum Dare 26. The levels are poor, the audio is terrible, and the “puzzles” are mostly based on player speed. The code is <a href="https://github.com/komiga/ld26-prisma">available</a> under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 3.0</a> license.</p>


{! Section.nav(C, "misc") !}

<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/elian-fonts">Elian fonts</a>: variant-width and monospace fonts for the <a target="_blank" href="http://ccelian.com/concepca.html">Elian script</a> (including FontForge source files).</li>
</ul>
