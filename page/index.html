{! Section.nav(C, "about") !}

<p>I am Coranna. I observe. I break. I make. I confound.</p>

<p>I write at <a target="_blank" href="http://allopoeia.komiga.com">Allopoeia</a>. Sometimes I make <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/random-va">voices</a> (and imitations of non-voices), <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/things-that-resemble-music">music</a> (maybe), and <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/things-that-resemble-sound">sounds</a>.</p>

<p>Talk to me if you must know more.</p>

{! Section.item(C, "Pickle", "https://github.com/komiga/pickle") !}

<p>A static site generator using Lua and togo. It's more versatile than, say, Jekyll or Hugo &ndash; in my opinion, of course &ndash; but it has a while to go before the kinks are hammered out. My websites use it.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "precore", "https://github.com/komiga/precore") !}

<p>An extension of <a target="_blank" href="http://industriousone.com/what-premake">Premake</a>. It facilitates build setup reuse, making the already pleasant Premake even more pleasant.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "togo", "https://github.com/komiga/togo") !}

<p>A C++ data-oriented super-library. It began as a game engine, but I found its design too appealing to leave it all bound up in a high-dependency library. As a result, togo is now composed of multiple components (libraries and tools). I am using it for all of my new projects, largely eschewing the C++ stdlib.</p>

<p>It is replacing many of the projects I started under earlier, poorer, design principles.</p>

	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/include_sort">include_sort</a>: order-explicit inclusion sorter for C and C++.</li>

{! Section.item(C, "Onomo", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&amp;uid=14542") !}

<p>A dark, moody platformer concept created over a 48-hour period for Ludum Dare 30. I neglected mechanics and made <em>something</em> that is only compelling in aesthetic. The code is <a href="https://github.com/komiga/ld30-onomo">available</a> under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 3.0</a> license.</p>

{! Section.item(C, "Prisma", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;uid=14542") !}

<p>A minimalistic color-based quasi-puzzle game created over a 72-hour period for Ludum Dare 26. The levels are poor, the audio is terrible, and the “puzzles” are mostly based on player speed. The code is <a href="https://github.com/komiga/ld26-prisma">available</a> under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 3.0</a> license.</p>
