{! Section.nav(C, "about") !}

<p>I am Coranna, a quietly intense thinker and crafter from the Seattle, Washington area. My pronouns are ze/zir.</p>

<p>I write at {! anchor_ext("http://allopoeia.komiga.com", "Allopoeia") !}. Sometimes I make {! anchor_ext("https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/random-va", "voices") !} (and imitations of non-voices), {! anchor_ext("https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/things-that-resemble-music", "music") !} (maybe), and {! anchor_ext("https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/things-that-resemble-sound", "sounds") !}.</p>

<p>I'm currently looking for remote (or very local) programming work and small (low or no budget) collaborative projects. See my {! anchor("/resume", "resumé") !} for more details.</p>


{! Section.nav(C, "code") !}

{! Section.item(C, "Pickle", "https://github.com/komiga/pickle") !}

<p>A static site generator. It's more versatile than, say, Jekyll or Hugo (in my opinion, of course), but it has a while to go before the kinks are hammered out.</p>

<p>My websites make good use of it.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "precore", "https://github.com/komiga/precore") !}

<p>An extension of {! anchor_ext("http://industriousone.com/what-premake", "Premake") !}. It facilitates build setup reuse, making the already pleasant Premake even more pleasant.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "Quanta", "https://github.com/komiga/quanta") !}

<p>An adaptive toolset for tracking… everything. Its primary facility is time-tracking, with a text format at its core specialized for describing the physical realm. Though Quanta is currently passive (with some validation), it will soon expand into analytics (e.g., distraction identification, correlation, and nutritional analysis).</p>


{! Section.item(C, "togo", "https://github.com/komiga/togo") !}

<p>A C++ data-oriented super-library. It began as a game engine, but I found its design too appealing to leave it all bound up in a high-dependency library. As a result, togo is now composed of multiple components (libraries and tools). I am using it for all of my new projects, largely eschewing the C++ Standard Library.</p>

<p>It is replacing many of the projects I started under earlier, poorer, design principles.</p>


{! Section.sub(C, "tools") !}

<ul>
	<li>{! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/include_sort", "include_sort") !}: inclusion sorter for C and C++.</li>

	<li>{! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/igen", "igen") !}: libclang-based interface generator for C++.</li>
</ul>


{! Section.sub(C, "reverse-engineering") !}

<ul>
	<li>{! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/brinktools", "brinktools") !}: ancient code and docs for BRINK's SDMD2 and SDPK2 formats.</li>
</ul>


{! Section.sub(C, "graveyard") !}

<p>These are bad projects from my early days.</p>

<ul>
	<li>{! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/am", "All the Maths‽") !}: a mathematics library for C++.</li>

	<li>{! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/Beard", "Beard") !}: a terminal UI for C++.</li>

	<li>{! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/Cacophony", "Cacophony") !}: a serialization library for C++.</li>

	<li>{! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/duct-cpp", "duct++") !}: a general-purpose library for C++.</li>

	<li>{! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/trait_wrangler", "Trait Wrangler") !}: a small trait testing library for C++.</li>
</ul>

{! Section.nav(C, "games") !}

{! Section.item(C, "Onomo", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&amp;uid=14542") !}

<p>A slow, dark platformer concept created over a 48-hour period for Ludum Dare 30. I neglected mechanics and made <em>something</em> that is only compelling in aesthetic. The code is {! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/ld30-onomo", "available") !} under the {! anchor_ext("http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/", "CC BY-NC-ND 3.0") !} license.</p>

{! Section.item(C, "Prisma", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;uid=14542") !}

<p>A minimalistic color-based twitch puzzler created over a 72-hour period for Ludum Dare 26. The levels are poor, the audio is terrible, and the “puzzles” are mostly based on player speed. The code is {! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/ld26-prisma", "available") !} under the {! anchor_ext("http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/", "CC BY-NC-ND 3.0") !} license.</p>


{! Section.nav(C, "misc") !}

<ul>
	<li>{! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/elian-fonts", "Elian fonts") !}: variant-width and monospace fonts for the {! anchor_ext("http://ccelian.com/concepca.html", "Elian script") !} (including FontForge source files).</li>
</ul>
