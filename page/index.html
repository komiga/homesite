{! Section.nav(C, "about") !}

<p><em>(nb: currently outdated, will be reworked)</em></p>

<p>Hi! My name is Coranna (she/her). I do a lot of thinking and crafting.</p>

<p>My primary medium is code, a selection of which follows in the next section. I also sometimes dabble in {! anchor("#art-and-games", "games, generative art") !}, and {! anchor_ext("https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/sounds-for-contemplating-the", "music") !} (maybe?).</p>

<p>I currently work as a software engineer in the US. {! anchor_ext("mailto:me@komiga.com", "Contact me") !} for my resumé or for any other reason.</p>

{! Section.item(C, "Pickle", "https://github.com/komiga/pickle") !}

<p>A static site generator utilizing Lua as a DSL.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "precore", "https://github.com/komiga/precore") !}

<p>An extension of {! anchor_ext("http://premake.github.io/", "Premake") !} 4.4. It facilitates build setup reuse, making the already-pleasant Premake even more so.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "Quanta", "https://github.com/komiga/quanta") !}

<p>A highly adaptable toolset for tracking. Its primary facility is time tracking, with a text format at its foundation specialized for describing the physical realm. Though Quanta is currently passive (with some validation), it will soon expand into analytics (e.g., craft efficiency, resource consumption, nutrition). It's being rewritten in Rust!</p>


{! Section.item(C, "togo", "https://github.com/komiga/togo") !}

<p>A C++ data-oriented super-library. It began as a game engine, but I found its design too appealing to leave it all bound up in a high-dependency library. As a result, togo is now composed of multiple components (libraries and tools). The game library is nascent, but the core library is a fully capable (very stdlib-minimal) base library for anything else.</p>


{! Section.sub(C, "tools") !}

<ul>
	<li>{! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/igen", "igen") !}: libclang-based interface generator for C++.</li>

	<li>{! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/include_sort", "include_sort") !}: inclusion sorter for C and C++.</li>
</ul>


{! Section.sub(C, "reverse-engineering") !}

<ul>
	<li>{! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/brinktools", "brinktools") !}: ancient code and docs for BRINK's SDMD2 and SDPK2 formats.</li>
</ul>

{! Section.item(C, "Onomo", "http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&uid=14542") !}

<p>A slow, dark platformer concept created over a 48-hour period for Ludum Dare 30. I neglected mechanics and made <em>something</em> that is only compelling in aesthetic. The code is {! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/ld30-onomo", "available") !} under the {! anchor_ext("http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/", "CC BY-NC-ND 3.0") !} license.</p>

{! Section.item(C, "Prisma", "http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=14542") !}

<p>A minimalistic color-based twitch puzzler created over a 72-hour period for Ludum Dare 26. The levels are poor, the audio is terrible, and the “puzzles” are mostly based on player speed. The code is {! anchor_ext("https://github.com/komiga/ld26-prisma", "available") !} under the {! anchor_ext("http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/", "CC BY-NC-ND 3.0") !} license.</p>

{! Section.item(C, "sounds for contemplating the universe", "https://komiga.itch.io/sounds-for-contemplating-the-universe") !}

<p>A short aural journey to accompany thoughts of life beyond your star system. Created with SunVox for {! anchor_ext("https://itch.io/jam/fermi-paradox-jam", "Fermi Paradox Jam") !} in 2016. {! anchor_ext("http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0", "CC BY-NC 4.0") !}.</p>

{! Section.item(C, "Kaleidograph", "http://imgur.com/a/NFwTo", nil, " <em>(stills)</em>") !}

<p>An interactive generative art program which creates snowflakey kaleidographic patterns. Created with JavaScript and p5.js in December 2014. <em>(A selection of still images; code is not publicly available.)</em></p>
