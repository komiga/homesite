{! Section.nav(C, "about") !}

<p>I am Coranna. I observe. I break. I make. I confound.</p>

<p>I write at <a target="_blank" href="http://allopoeia.komiga.com">Allopoeia</a>. Sometimes I make <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/random-va">voices</a> (and imitations of non-voices), <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/things-that-resemble-music">music</a> (maybe), and <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/komiga/sets/things-that-resemble-sound">sounds</a>.</p>

<p>Talk to me if you must know more.</p>

{! Section.item(C, "Pickle", "https://github.com/komiga/pickle") !}

<p>A static site generator using Lua and togo. It's more versatile than, say, Jekyll or Hugo &ndash; in my opinion, of course &ndash; but it has a while to go before the kinks are hammered out. My websites use it.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "precore", "https://github.com/komiga/precore") !}

<p>An extension of <a target="_blank" href="http://industriousone.com/what-premake">Premake</a>. It facilitates build setup reuse, making the already pleasant Premake even more pleasant.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "Quanta", "https://github.com/komiga/quanta") !}

<p>An adaptive toolset for tracking… everything. Its primary facility is time-tracking, with a text format at its core specialized for describing the physical realm. Though Quanta is currently passive (with some validation), it will soon expand into analytics and prediction (e.g., identifying distraction, eager fact correlation, and nutrition).</p>

<p>I use Quanta to track every action I take (i.e., every second of every day), to track nutrition (to the gram & milligram), to spot-check vitals, to store my schedule &amp; todo lists, and to write my journal.</p>

<p>It's a <em>bit</em> obsessive, but I see the ritual as a valuable lifelong science project. The overhead of tracking itself is mostly insignificant, and it decreases as I advance the assistive aspects of Quanta.</p>

<p>The most <em>effort</em> expended in tracking actually comes from transcribing immediate history. As of writing, Quanta is PC-bound, but I have plans for a pared-down cellphone app to track entries while I'm away from my PC. The present most significant assistive role Quanta has to play is in erasing this friction.</p>


{! Section.item(C, "togo", "https://github.com/komiga/togo") !}

<p>A C++ data-oriented super-library. It began as a game engine, but I found its design too appealing to leave it all bound up in a high-dependency library. As a result, togo is now composed of multiple components (libraries and tools). I am using it for all of my new projects, largely eschewing the C++ stdlib.</p>

<p>It is replacing many of the projects I started under earlier, poorer, design principles.</p>

{! Section.item(C, "Onomo", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&amp;uid=14542") !}

<p>A dark, moody platformer concept created over a 48-hour period for Ludum Dare 30. I neglected mechanics and made <em>something</em> that is only compelling in aesthetic. The code is <a href="https://github.com/komiga/ld30-onomo">available</a> under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 3.0</a> license.</p>

{! Section.item(C, "Prisma", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;uid=14542") !}

<p>A minimalistic color-based quasi-puzzle game created over a 72-hour period for Ludum Dare 26. The levels are poor, the audio is terrible, and the “puzzles” are mostly based on player speed. The code is <a href="https://github.com/komiga/ld26-prisma">available</a> under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 3.0</a> license.</p>
